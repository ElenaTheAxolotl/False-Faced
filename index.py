# detective game heheheheheh

# Scene 1: Intro

# Description: 

# You stand in the middle of a hotel room, one barely big enough to fit two beds let alone the amount of people currently
# inspecting it. The most notable part of the room is on the bed nearest to the window. There, under a plastice sheet, lies
# a dead body. It is heavily suspected that foul play is involved. You, the leading detective on this case, must figure out
# what happened to the deceased.

# What will you do first? (Enter the letter)

# Choices:

# A: Inspect the body
# B: Examine the room

# Outcomes: basically just moving to another scene

# A: get info about dead person (Scene 2)
# B: get info about the room (Scene 3)

# Consequences: none for either


# Scene 2: The Body

# Description:

# The deceased is a young man named Lucas Park, a nobody in the grand scheme of things. The file on him you were provided
# with revealed nothing substantial. The only things of note were that he had no known living relatives and had been
# arrested with charges of assult and battery, though the charges were dropped before a trial was held.
# You step to where the body lay on the bed. Lifting the plastic covering you see...a face of peace. There is no hint of
# pain or fear, almost as though the body is simply sleepiing. It has not been long enough for the body to start decaying. 
# Peace is all you see...
# You lower the plastic covering over the body again as you hear your...partner walking over to the body.
# "You know, I guess being in bed isn't the worst place to die," he says, irritately relaxed. "Though I can't imagine it's
# a super comfortable bed." You still cannot fathom how he got this job, let alone why you are forced to have him as a
# work partner.

# "What say you, lead detective? What do you think happened to this guy?"

# Choices:

# A: "Forensics has not confirmed anything yet."
# B: "It was poison."
# C: Ignore him

# Outcomes: (will add the actual dialouge later and gotta figure out how to track which scenes have been done)

# A: continue dialogue, option to move to scene 3 or scene 4
# B: continue dialogue, option to move to scene 3 or scene 4
# C: continue dialouge, option to move to scene 3 or scene 4

# Consequences:

# A: minus 1 suspicion
# B: plus 1 suspicion
# C: nothing


# Scene 3: The Room

# Description:

# Looking around the room, there is not much to see. A few forensics workers are looking for evidence, but the room is
# practically bare, the only furniture being the two beds, a television, and a dresser below the television. There are two
# suitcases on the floor, one opened with clothes falling out of it while the other is completely shut, as though it was
# ready to be picked up and leave at a moment's notice.
# Your attention on the suitcases appearently drew the attention of someones else: your...partner. He walks up to you,
# asking, 

# "Think the suitcases could lead to something, lead detective?"

# Choices:

# A: "One of them knew they were in danger."
# B: "Not until we know whose is whose."
# C: Ignore him

# Outcomes:

# A: continue dialogue, option to move to scene 2 or 4
# B: continue dialogue, option to move to scene 2 or 4
# C: continue dialogue, option to move to scene 2 or 4

# Consequences:

# A: plus 1 suspicion
# B: minus 1 suspicion
# C: nothing


# Scene 4: The Enterance

# Description:

# At the entrance to the room stands one of the members of the hotel's staff and a young man, close to if not the same age
# as the deceased. They are talking to one of the officers, supposedly about the dead body in the room. You walk to the
# doorway where they stand, going to get information from them as well, your partner following you like a pathetic hound.

# Who will you speak to first?

# Choices:

# A: The young man
# B: The staff member

# Outcomes: again, basically just moving scenes

# A: scene 5
# B: scene 6

# Consequences: none
