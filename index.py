# detective game heheheheheh

# Scene 1: Intro

# Description: 

# You stand in the middle of a hotel room, one barely big enough to fit two beds let alone the amount of people currently
# inspecting it. The most notable part of the room is on the bed nearest to the window. There, under a plastice sheet, lies
# a dead body. It is heavily suspected that foul play is involved. You, the leading detective on this case, must figure out
# what happened to the deceased.

# What will you do first? (Enter the letter)

# Choices:

# A: Inspect the body
# B: Examine the room

# Outcomes: basically just moving to another scene

# A: get info about dead person (Scene 2)
# B: get info about the room (Scene 3)

# Consequences: none for either


# Scene 2: The Body

# Description:

# The deceased is a young man named Lucas Park, a nobody in the grand scheme of things. The file on him you were provided
# with revealed nothing substantial. The only things of note were that he had no known living relatives and had been
# arrested with charges of assult and battery, though the charges were dropped before a trial was held.
# You step to where the body lay on the bed. Lifting the plastic covering you see...a face of peace. There is no hint of
# pain or fear, almost as though the body is simply sleepiing. It has not been long enough for the body to start decaying. 
# Peace is all you see...
# You lower the plastic covering over the body again as you hear your...partner walking over to the body.
# "You know, I guess being in bed isn't the worst place to die," he says, irritately relaxed. "Though I can't imagine it's
# a super comfortable bed." You still cannot fathom how he got this job, let alone why you are forced to have him as a
# work partner.

# "What say you, lead detective? What do you think happened to this guy?"

# Choices:

# A: "Forensics has not confirmed anything yet."
# B: "It was poison."

# Scene 3: The Room

# Description:

# Looking around the room, there is not much to see. A few forensics workers are looking for evidence, but the room is
# practically bare, the only furniture being the two beds, a television, and a dresser below the television. There are two
# suitcases on the floor, one opened with clothes falling out of it while the other is completely shut, as though it was
# ready to be picked up and leave at a moment's notice.
# Your attention on the suitcases appearently drew the attention of someones else: your...partner. He walks up to you,
# asking,
